# World-s-Largest-Banks-ETL
This project scrapes data from a website to extract information about the top 10 largest banks using Python. It transforms the data to include additional fields, such as Market Cap in EUR and INR, and stores the data in both a CSV file and a database table. Additionally, it generates a log file that tracks the timestamps of each process.
